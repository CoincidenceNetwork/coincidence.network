    <TextBlock title="Vision">
      A world of meaningful relationships, where happiness and cooperation prevail. A matchmaking experience that is
      pleasant and safe, transforming the way we connect and relate.
    </TextBlock>
    <TextBlock title="The Problem">
      We are social beings, choosing who we are connected with has a great influence on our lives. In one human life, we
      relate deeply with tens of people, and lightly with hundreds to tens of thousands. There are 8.1 billion humans
      (circa 2023) that we can connect with, far beyond what is intuitively understandable. To navigate these countless
      potential connections, we usually rely on local circumstances, events, workplace, friend-of-friend connections.
      <br /><br />
       These are powerful, but now the world is global, industrialized, and enabled with the Internet. To find each
      other, we use matchmaking, networking, dating, and even event apps â€” Tinder, Meetup, Swapcard, Peanut, etc. These
      efforts are limited by their design, technology, culture, and purpose. They do not empower us with the most
      meaningful connections across varied contexts. They are the beginning of matchmaking technology, not the end. It
      can be much better.
    </TextBlock>
    <TextBlock title="The Solution">
      Coincidence is the solution is to advance the technology and culture of matchmaking, for the empowering of
      meaningful relations. It will bring us beyond serendipity, status quo matchmaking apps, and traditional ways of
      social connection.
      <br /><br />Coincidence is a matchmaking app of multiple aspects. In general, it allows for connection
      recommendations from various methodologies: shared interests, verifiable commonalities, deep learning, etc. The
      Coincidence Events aspect specializes matchmaking to the contexts of conferences, hackathons, workshops, etc. The
      Coincidence Scholar aspect allows researchers and students to meet from specific publications or interests. These
      are the initial aspects. Notably, Coincidence is also an open protocol, thereby enabling the community to augment
      their special context with a matchmaking substrate.
